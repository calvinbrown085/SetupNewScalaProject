##Scala Project Setup Script

1. Make sure you have python installed on your computer
1. Download or clone this repository
1. Move Setup.py into the empty repository that you have made or cloned.
1. run `python Setup.py`
1. The script should do the rest of the work for you.

This script will create a `src/main/scala` and a `src/main/test` empty directory's so you don't have too.

This script will also create a basic Main.scala file with a main function to run things from

It will also create an empty `readme.md` and an empty `.gitignore`
